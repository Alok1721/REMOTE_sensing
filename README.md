##Climate Change Prediction using Remote Sensing
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project that uses satellite images and remote sensing data to predict climate change. The project utilizes NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), CO2 levels, precipitation, sea surface temperature, and machine learning techniques such as LSTM and Random Forest to forecast future environmental conditions.

##Project Overview
The project analyzes historical environmental data over the last 15 years, tracks the variation of key climate parameters, and predicts future trends. The goal is to leverage predictive models to better understand and mitigate the effects of climate change.

#Key Features:
NDVI Analysis: Monitoring vegetation health and its correlation with climate change.
CO2 Level Monitoring: Tracking the rise in CO2 levels and its impact on the environment.
Climate Predictions: Forecasting climate patterns using LSTM and Random Forest models.
Interactive Visualizations: Displaying trends and predictions through engaging visual representations.
Visualizations
Below are key visualizations that highlight the impact of climate change on various environmental parameters:

1. NDVI Variation in India
This visualization shows the variation in vegetation health (NDVI) across India over a defined period. The map provides insights into how plant life has been responding to changes in the environment due to climate change.



2. CO2 Concentration Variation in India
This image represents the variation of CO2 levels across India. Tracking CO2 levels is crucial in understanding greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on climate change.



3. Global Warming and Climate Prediction (2010-2040)
This plot shows the future predictions of climate change from 2010 to 2040 using machine learning models such as LSTM and Random Forest. It helps in understanding the projected impact of climate change in the coming decades.



4. Climate Change Variation Over Time
This visualization demonstrates how different environmental parameters have changed over time due to global warming. It highlights key shifts and anomalies that are directly linked to climate change.



How It Works
The project analyzes data from reliable platforms such as NASAâ€™s MODIS for NDVI and NOAA for CO2 levels and sea surface temperature. These data are processed using machine learning models to forecast climate trends. Interactive visualizations are then generated to present these predictions in an easily interpretable manner.
