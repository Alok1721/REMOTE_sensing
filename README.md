# Climate Change Prediction using Remote Sensing

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project that uses satellite images and remote sensing data to predict climate change. The project utilizes NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), CO2 levels, precipitation, sea surface temperature, and machine learning techniques such as LSTM and Random Forest to forecast future environmental conditions.

Below are key visualizations that highlight the impact of climate change on various environmental parameters:

1. **NDVI Variation in India**  
   This visualization shows the variation in vegetation health (NDVI) across India over a defined period. The map provides insights into how plant life has been responding to changes in the environment due to climate change.

2. **CO2 Concentration Variation in India**  
   This image represents the variation of CO2 levels across India. Tracking CO2 levels is crucial in understanding greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on climate change.

3. **Global Warming and Climate Prediction (2010-2040)**  
   This plot shows the future predictions of climate change from 2010 to 2040 using machine learning models such as LSTM and Random Forest. It helps in understanding the projected impact of climate change in the coming decades.

4. **Climate Change Variation Over Time**  
   This visualization demonstrates how different environmental parameters have changed over time due to global warming. It highlights key shifts and anomalies that are directly linked to climate change.

## How It Works
The project analyzes data from reliable platforms such as NASAâ€™s MODIS for NDVI and NOAA for CO2 levels and sea surface temperature. These data are processed using machine learning models to forecast climate trends. Interactive visualizations are then generated to present these predictions in an easily interpretable manner.
